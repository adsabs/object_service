* Implementation of new query parsing method using the luqum (LUcene QUery Manipolator) module
  * luqum credentials: developed by Jurismarch√©s (https://github.com/jurismarches/luqum)
  * License: GNU General Public License v3.0
  * the module has been adapted to be compatible with Python 2.7
* The luqum module is used to create a query tree from the Solr query string to identify the object: modifiers
* This fixes the bug that e.g. "object:Andromeda OR abs:Andromeda" gets translated into "simbid:123 OR 0:123"

  database:astronomy as restriction
